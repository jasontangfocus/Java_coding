/*
Tree Concepts:

Root:	The nodes at the top of the trees.
Parent:	When any node (except the root) has exactly one edge runnning upward to another node. The node above is called parent of the node.
Child:	Any node may have one or more lines running downward to other nodes. These nodes below the given node called its children.
Edge:	Connection between one node to another.
Leaf:	A node that has no children is called a leaf. There can be only one root in a tree but there can be many leaves.
Levels:	The level of a particular node refers to how geenrations the node is from the root. The root is level 0 and its children are level 1 and so on.
Height:	The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
Path:	a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
